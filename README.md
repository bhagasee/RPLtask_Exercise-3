RPLtask#_Exercise #3
In this code, the function calculate_service_cost() takes two parameters: account_number and amount_of_sale. It checks if the account number exists in the ACCOUNTS dictionary and if its status code is "valid". If the precondition is met, it returns an invoice with the account number and amount of sale. If the precondition fails, it returns an error message.
